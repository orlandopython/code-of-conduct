# Code of Conduct

*This code of conduct is based on the one from Django Girls found at [https://djangogirls.org/coc/](https://djangogirls.org/coc/)*

The Orlando Python User Group (OPUG) aims to be a welcoming event, where people meet in a friendly environment. Accordingly, we expect that all participants are expected to show respect and courtesy to other participants at every meetup and in the GitHub organization.

To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and volunteers at any OPUG event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code before and throughout the event.

## In short

- OPUG is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
- We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form.
- Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks.
- Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Don't publish photographs of people without their consent. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for OPUG.
- Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event, meetup, or GitHub organization at the discretion of the group organizers.

## Longer version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for OPUG.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the group organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event, meetup, or GitHub organization.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all OPUG events, venues, and GitHub organization interactions.

## Reporting harassment

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact one of the group organizers immediately. If your concern is with one of the group organizers, please contact one of the other organizers with details. **No one is exempt from this code of conduct**.

The organizers are well informed on how to deal with the incident and how to further proceed with the situation. The organizers and venue staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance and involvement with future events and projects.
